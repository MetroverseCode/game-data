# Game Data

Game piece metadata, building information, and historical leaderboards.

### Here is what you can find in the various sub-directories:

`buildings-information` - Detailed information about each building that makes up a block in the genesis, genesis mini, and blackout collections.

`leaderboards` - A historical record of Metroverse leaderboards. This includes metro point (global), hood boost, and metro battle leaderboards.

The metadata JSON for each block can be found here:

Replace `BLOCK_ID` with the ID of any block to obtain its metdata JSON.
