# Game Data

Game piece metadata, building information, and historical leaderboards.

### Here is what you can find in the various sub-directories:

`buildings-information` - Detailed information about each building that makes up a block in the genesis, genesis mini, and blackout collections.

`leaderboards` - A historical record of Metroverse leaderboards. This includes metro point (global), hood boost, and metro battle leaderboards.

The metadata JSON for each NFT can be found here:

`https://metroverse.com/NFT/BLOCK_ID`

Replace `NFT` with blocks/mayors/passes and `BLOCK_ID` with the ID of any NFT to obtain its metdata JSON.

The individual building entities can be accessed and downloaded here:

`https://metroverse.com/assets/COLLECTION/ENTITY_NAME.png`

Replace `COLLECTION` with blackout/genesis/genesis-mini and `ENTITY_NAME` with the filename defined in the Buildings Information CSVs found in `/buildings-information` to obtain the individual building entity file.
